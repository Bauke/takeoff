Takeoff is a **bring-your-own-site** static site generator, meaning it comes with no presets, templates or themes built-in. It is made in such a way to allow you to create a static site completely on your own terms, without having to write the code necessary to build it.

You write your own Markdown, HTML, CSS and everything else that makes up the site, and then let Takeoff put it all together.
